- **Player Turns:** The game keeps track of whose turn it is and displays a message indicating the current player.
- **Winner Detection:** The game automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Game:** Players can restart the game at any time to play again.

## How to Play

1. The game board consists of a 3x3 grid.
2. Player 1 is 'X' and Player 2 is 'O'.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
4. The game will detect if a player has won (three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal) or if the game ends in a draw.
5. To start a new game, click on the "Restart Game" button.
